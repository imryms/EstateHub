##### When visiting the website, any person can view it as a guest. They will see the landing page, which includes a navigation bar for Home, Browse, Log In, and Register. However, to pick an appointment for visiting the site, they need to sign up or log in as a registered user. Once logged in, they can access the different sections of the website.
